em-couchdb is a simple, convenient, and non blocking client for CouchDBi built as an EventMachine protocol. CouchDB (simplistically speaking) is a document store, which essentially means that objects can be stored in a schema-less environment.

What it is?
-----------
With em-couchdb, you can easily save, query, delete documents, databases to/from a CouchDB database in your favourite language - Ruby. 

Why?
----
I love NoSQL. As well I love working with EventMachine and have too much time in hand :).
